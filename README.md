üíª CAD Command Center
The CAD Command Center is a Streamlit-based web application designed for ASIC/FPGA physical design engineers and CAD infrastructure managers. It provides unified dashboards for optimizing physical design trade-offs (Floorplanning) and monitoring high-value EDA tool licenses and known tool issues.

üöÄ Features
This application is split into two main dashboards:

1. üß± Floorplan Strategy Analyzer
Netlist Simulation: Generates synthetic netlist data (blocks, connectivity, timing, area) for a target project (e.g., "AI Accelerator").

Strategy Comparison: Simulates and compares multiple floorplan strategies (Flat, Functional, Random, and optimized Connectivity-Driven partition via Louvain algorithm).

Multi-Objective Analysis: Visualizes trade-offs between critical metrics: Timing (Critical Path), Area Utilization, Power Proxy, and Routability Score (congestion risk).

Physical Visualization: Generates physical floorplan layouts and inter-module connectivity graphs.

Export: Allows export of metrics (CSV) and the final floorplan (DEF/TCL format proxy).

2. üìä EDA Infrastructure Monitor
License Utilization: Monitors real-time license usage, highlighting critical shortages and displaying overall usage metrics.

Cost Efficiency: Calculates and highlights the most cost-inefficient tools (highest annual unused license cost).

Vendor Filtering: Allows filtering license metrics by EDA vendor (Synopsys, Cadence, etc.).

Bug Tracker: Provides a centralized, persistent registry for known EDA tool bugs, versions, workarounds, and status updates.

Tool Registry: Tracks approved, stable tool versions for specific projects to ensure design reproducibility.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Local Setup
To run this application locally, you need Python 3.9+ and the required dependencies.

Prerequisites
Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/tinouchemassinissa/CelestialAi_app.git](https://github.com/tinouchemassinissa/CelestialAi_app.git)
cd CelestialAi_app

Create Virtual Environment (Recommended):

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
# source venv/bin/activate # On Linux/macOS

Install Dependencies
Install all required libraries listed in requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

The application relies on the following key libraries:

streamlit

pandas

numpy

plotly

networkx

python-louvain

Run the Application
Execute the main Streamlit file:

streamlit run streamlit_app.py

The application will automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment (AWS App Runner)

This application supports **Continuous Delivery (CD)** via AWS App Runner, automatically deploying updates when changes are pushed to GitHub.
